## 🎯 Deployment Options (Choose One)

### **Option 1: Vercel (EASIEST - Recommended)**

**Step 1:** Go to https://vercel.com and sign in with GitHub

**Step 2:** Create new project or use existing

**Step 3:** Upload these files to your project:
```
src/pages/
├── Pricing.tsx (the UPDATED version)
├── Pricing.css
├── Terms.tsx (the UPDATED version)
├── Terms.css
├── Privacy.tsx (the UPDATED version)
└── Privacy.css
```

**Step 4:** Add routes in your App.tsx:
```typescript
import Pricing from './pages/Pricing';
import Terms from './pages/Terms';
import Privacy from './pages/Privacy';

// In your routes:
<Route path="/pricing" element={<Pricing />} />
<Route path="/terms" element={<Terms />} />
<Route path="/privacy" element={<Privacy />} />
```

**Step 5:** Deploy! Vercel will give you a URL like: `compute-io.vercel.app`

---

### **Option 2: Keep Using Replit**

If you want to stay in Replit for now:

**Step 1:** In Replit, navigate to `client/src/pages/`

**Step 2:** Replace the old files with the UPDATED versions:
- Delete old `Pricing.tsx.txt`
- Upload `Pricing-UPDATED.tsx` and rename to `Pricing.tsx`
- Do the same for Terms and Privacy

**Step 3:** Make sure CSS files are renamed (remove .txt)

**Step 4:** Click "Publish" in Replit

## 💰 How Payments Work (Manual Process)

### When a customer wants to pay:

**Customer Journey:**
1. Goes to `/pricing` page
2. Clicks "Connect Wallet"
3. Clicks "Pay 29 USDC" (or any tier)
4. Transaction happens on Base network
5. They get a transaction hash
6. They email you: paigeblanch09@gmail.com with the hash

**Your Process:**
1. Check email for transaction hash
2. Go to https://basescan.org
3. Paste transaction hash to verify payment
4. Confirm they sent correct amount to your wallet
5. Generate API key for them (use your existing system)
6. Email them the API key
7. Done! 💰

**Time:** ~5 minutes per customer

---

## 🔑 Generating API Keys

You already have this working! When you get a payment, just:

### Option A: Use your existing dashboard
- Log into your admin panel
- Create new API key for the user
- Copy and email it to them

### Option B: Run a command (if you have CLI)
```bash
# Whatever command you use to generate keys
npm run create-api-key user@email.com
```

### Option C: Database directly
```sql
INSERT INTO api_keys (user_id, key, balance, active)
VALUES (?, 'sk_live_...', 5.98, true);
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Common issues:**

**"Wallet not connecting"**
- Make sure MetaMask/Coinbase Wallet installed
- Check if Base network is added
- Try refreshing page

**"Transaction failed"**
- User needs ETH on Base for gas (~$0.01)
- Make sure they're on Base network, not Ethereum mainnet
- Check they have enough USDC

**"How do I verify payment?"**
- Go to https://basescan.org
- Paste transaction hash
- Verify "To" address is yours: 0xB4ac8Da2C07a43f52CA04080348e1afadDe2A651
- Verify amount matches tier price

## 💡 Tips for Success

**Week 1:** Manual everything, learn what customers need

**Week 2-3:** Get 5-10 paying customers, gather feedback

**Week 4+:** Then we automate (Option B) - payment webhooks, auto API key generation, etc.

Don't over-engineer! Get revenue first, optimize later.
