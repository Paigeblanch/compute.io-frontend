# Compute.io Pre-Launch Checklist

A comprehensive guide to preparing your Math & Physics API for public release.

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL PRIORITY** (Must Fix Before Launch)

### ✅ 1. Remove Exposed API Keys from Code Examples
**Why it matters:** Exposed API keys can be stolen and used to rack up charges on your account or access your systems.

**Steps:**
1. Review ALL code examples on your site (hero section, documentation, tutorials)
2. Replace any real API keys with placeholder text: `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` or `sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`
3. In the hero code example, change:
   ```
   -H "X-Payment-Token: sk_live_..." \
   ```
   to:
   ```
   -H "X-Payment-Token: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
   ```
4. Add a note explaining: "Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key from the dashboard"
5. Double-check screenshots, documentation, and any embedded code snippets

---

### ✅ 2. Deploy to Production & Custom Domain
**Why it matters:** The Replit dev URL signals this is unfinished and can't be trusted for production use. Custom domains look professional and build credibility.

**Steps:**
1. **Purchase a domain** (if you haven't already):
   - Consider: `compute.io`, `computeapi.com`, `mathphysics.io`
   - Use Namecheap, Google Domains, or Cloudflare
   - Cost: ~$10-15/year

2. **Deploy your app**:
   - In Replit, click "Deploy" button (top right)
   - Choose a deployment type (Autoscale recommended for APIs)
   - Follow Replit's deployment wizard

3. **Connect your custom domain**:
   - In Replit deployment settings, add your custom domain
   - Update DNS records at your domain registrar:
     - Add CNAME record pointing to Replit's deployment URL
     - Or add A records if provided by Replit
   - Wait 5-60 minutes for DNS propagation

4. **Update all references**:
   - Change base URL in documentation from dev URL to `https://api.compute.io`
   - Update code examples
   - Update any marketing materials

5. **Set up SSL certificate** (Replit usually handles this automatically, but verify HTTPS works)

---

### ✅ 3. Add Legal Pages (Required for Paid Services)
**Why it matters:** You need legal protection and compliance with laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). Without these, you could face lawsuits or be unable to process payments.

**Steps:**
1. **Create Terms of Service page** (`/terms`):
   - Use a template from sites like Termly.io or GetTerms.io
   - Customize for API usage:
     - Acceptable use policy (no abuse, rate limits)
     - Payment terms and refund policy
     - Service availability disclaimers
     - Intellectual property rights
     - Limitation of liability
   - Consider hiring a lawyer for review (recommended for paid services)

2. **Create Privacy Policy page** (`/privacy`):
   - Explain what data you collect (API keys, usage logs, email, payment info)
   - How you use it (billing, service improvement, support)
   - Who you share it with (payment processors like Stripe)
   - User rights (access, deletion, export)
   - Cookie policy if you use analytics
   - Use Termly.io or similar to generate one

3. **Add links in footer**:
   - Make "Terms" and "Privacy" clickable in your footer
   - Currently shows "© 2024 Compute.io. All rights reserved." but no legal links

4. **Update copyright year**:
   - Change "© 2024" to "© 2025" (current year)

---

### ✅ 4. Build Authentication & User Dashboard
**Why it matters:** Users need a way to sign up, get API keys, and manage their account. Right now "Start Building" has nowhere to go.

**Steps:**
1. **Set up authentication system**:
   - Use Clerk, Auth0, Supabase Auth, or Firebase Auth for quick implementation
   - Or build with NextAuth.js if using Next.js
   - Implement: Sign up, Login, Password reset, Email verification

2. **Create user dashboard** (`/dashboard`):
   - Display user's API key(s) with copy button
   - Show usage statistics:
     - Requests this month
     - Cost this month
     - Remaining balance (if prepaid)
   - Billing section:
     - Current plan
     - Payment method on file
     - Invoice history
   - API key management:
     - Generate new keys
     - Revoke keys
     - Set spending limits per key

3. **Link "Start Building" button**:
   - Point to `/signup` or `/dashboard` (if logged in)
   - Implement redirect logic: if user is logged in, go to dashboard; if not, go to signup

4. **Add navigation menu**:
   - Add header menu with: Home, Documentation, Pricing, Dashboard/Login
   - Show "Login" button if not authenticated
   - Show "Dashboard" and user avatar/email if authenticated

---

## 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY** (Important for Success)

### ✅ 5. Create Comprehensive Pricing Page
**Why it matters:** You mention "pay-per-request" but don't show prices. Users won't commit without knowing costs.

**Steps:**
1. **Create `/pricing` page**
2. **Define your pricing model**:
   - Example structure:
     - $0.001 per simple calculation (algebra, arithmetic)
     - $0.005 per complex calculation (integrals, differential equations)
     - $0.01 per simulation run
     - Free tier: 1,000 requests/month
   
3. **Display pricing clearly**:
   - Use a pricing table with tier comparison
   - Show: Free, Starter ($29/mo), Pro ($99/mo), Enterprise (custom)
   - Highlight what's included in each tier
   - Add "Most Popular" badge to your target tier

4. **Add pricing calculator**:
   - Interactive tool: "If you make X requests/month, your cost is $Y"
   - Helps users estimate their costs

5. **Show cost comparison**:
   - "50% cheaper than running your own compute"
   - "10x faster than using an LLM for math"

6. **Address common questions**:
   - "What counts as one request?"
   - "Do failed requests count?"
   - "Can I set spending limits?"

---

### ✅ 6. Expand Documentation Significantly
**Why it matters:** Good docs = happy developers = more customers. Incomplete docs will frustrate users and increase support burden.

**Steps:**
1. **Create documentation structure** (use Docusaurus, GitBook, or custom):
   - Getting Started
   - Authentication
   - API Reference
   - Code Examples
   - Use Cases
   - Troubleshooting
   - FAQ

2. **Write Getting Started guide**:
   - How to sign up and get API key
   - Your first API call (complete working example)
   - How to interpret responses
   - Common errors and solutions
   - Expected response times

3. **Complete API Reference**:
   - All available endpoints
   - Request format for each (headers, body, parameters)
   - Response format (success and error cases)
   - HTTP status codes and what they mean
   - Rate limits per endpoint
   - Examples in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, cURL, Go)

4. **Add supported operations list**:
   - Math: algebra, calculus, linear algebra, statistics, trigonometry, etc.
   - Physics: kinematics, dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, etc.
   - Show specific examples: "integrate(x^2, x)" or "solve_projectile_motion(v0=50, angle=45)"

5. **Include error handling guide**:
   - What errors can occur
   - How to handle them gracefully
   - Retry logic recommendations
   - When to contact support

6. **Add SDKs or code libraries**:
   - Create Python package: `pip install compute-io`
   - JavaScript/Node.js: `npm install @compute-io/client`
   - Provide simple wrapper around your API
   - Example:
     ```python
     from compute_io import ComputeClient
     
     client = ComputeClient(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
     result = client.solve("integrate(x^2, x)")
     print(result)
     ```

---

### ✅ 7. Set Up Payment Processing
**Why it matters:** You can't charge customers without a payment system. This is essential for revenue.

**Steps:**
1. **Choose payment provider**:
   - Stripe (recommended - best developer experience)
   - Paddle (handles tax/VAT automatically)
   - Checkout.com
   - Braintree

2. **Integrate Stripe** (if chosen):
   - Create Stripe account at stripe.com
   - Get API keys (test and live)
   - Install Stripe SDK: `npm install stripe`
   - Implement:
     - Customer creation on signup
     - Payment method collection
     - Usage-based billing (meter API usage)
     - Invoice generation
     - Webhook handling for payment events

3. **Set up billing logic**:
   - Track API usage per user in database
   - Calculate costs based on your pricing
   - Generate invoices monthly (or as usage happens)
   - Charge customer's payment method
   - Handle failed payments (retry, notification, suspension)

4. **Add payment UI**:
   - Payment method management in dashboard
   - Add/update credit card
   - View invoices
   - Download receipts

5. **Implement spending limits**:
   - Allow users to set monthly spending caps
   - Pause API access if limit reached
   - Send notification when 80% of limit reached

---

### ✅ 8. Add Trust Signals & Social Proof
