## 🚀 Step 1: Add Files to Your Replit Project

### In your Replit project:

1. Navigate to your `src` folder
2. Create a `pages` folder if it doesn't exist: `src/pages/`
3. Upload or copy these files:
   ```
   src/
   ├── pages/
   │   ├── Terms.tsx
   │   ├── Terms.css
   │   ├── Privacy.tsx
   │   ├── Privacy.css
   │   ├── Pricing.tsx
   │   └── Pricing.css
   ```

## 🔧 Step 2: Set Up Routing

You'll need to add routes for these pages. Based on your Vite + React setup, you're likely using React Router.

### Install React Router (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Update your main App file (likely `src/App.tsx`):

```typescript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Terms from './pages/Terms';
import Privacy from './pages/Privacy';
import Pricing from './pages/Pricing';
import Playground from './pages/Playground'; // Your existing playground
import Dashboard from './pages/Dashboard'; // Your existing dashboard

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="app">
        {/* Your existing nav/header */}
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/pricing">Pricing</Link>
          <Link to="/playground">Playground</Link>
          <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
        </nav>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/pricing" element={<Pricing />} />
          <Route path="/playground" element={<Playground />} />
          <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
          <Route path="/terms" element={<Terms />} />
          <Route path="/privacy" element={<Privacy />} />
        </Routes>

        {/* Footer with legal links */}
        <footer>
          <Link to="/terms">Terms of Service</Link>
          <Link to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>
          <p>© 2025 Compute.io. All rights reserved.</p>
        </footer>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## 🔐 Step 3: Fix the API Key in Playground

In your existing Playground component, make sure the cURL example shows:

```javascript
-H "X-Payment-Token: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
```

Instead of the real API key currently showing.

---

## 💰 Step 4: Implement Base Payment Backend

The Pricing page has a basic wallet connection, but you need to complete the payment flow.

### Option A: Manual Verification (Simplest)

1. User connects wallet
2. User sends USDC/ETH to your address
3. They email you the transaction hash
4. You verify on Basescan and manually activate their API key

**Your Base Wallet Address:** [You need to create one]

### Option B: Coinbase Commerce (Recommended)

1. Sign up at https://commerce.coinbase.com/
2. Create a charge for each pricing tier
3. Add webhook endpoint to activate API keys

```bash
npm install @coinbase/coinbase-commerce-node
```

Example backend code (Node.js):
```javascript
const Commerce = require('@coinbase/coinbase-commerce-node');
const Client = Commerce.Client;

Client.init('YOUR_COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY');

// Create a charge
const chargeData = {
  name: 'Compute.io Starter Plan',
  description: '50,000 API requests/month',
  pricing_type: 'fixed_price',
  local_price: {
    amount: '29.00',
    currency: 'USD'
  }
};

const charge = await Charge.create(chargeData);
console.log(charge.hosted_url); // Send user here to pay
```

### Option C: Smart Contract (Most Advanced)

Deploy a simple payment contract on Base that:
- Accepts USDC/ETH payments
- Emits events when payment received
- Your backend listens for events and activates API keys

---

## 🌐 Step 5: Deploy to Production

### Deploy on Replit:

1. Click "Deploy" button in top right
2. Choose "Autoscale Deployment" (best for APIs)
3. Configure:
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Start Command:** `npm run preview` (or your server command)
   - **Port:** Usually 3000 or 5173

4. Wait for deployment (2-5 minutes)

### Set up custom domain:

1. Purchase domain (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. In Replit deployment settings, add custom domain
3. Update DNS records at your registrar:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @ (or www)
   Value: [Your Replit deployment URL]
   TTL: 3600
   ```
4. Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)

## ✅ Step 6: Essential Pre-Launch Checklist

Before going live, verify:

- [ ] API key placeholder in all code examples (no real keys exposed)
- [ ] Terms page accessible at `/terms`
- [ ] Privacy page accessible at `/privacy`
- [ ] Pricing page accessible at `/pricing`
- [ ] Footer has links to Terms and Privacy
- [ ] Contact email in Terms/Privacy (replace [YOUR_EMAIL])
- [ ] Your jurisdiction in Terms (replace [YOUR JURISDICTION])
- [ ] Wallet connection works on Pricing page
- [ ] Base network (Chain ID: 8453) is configured
- [ ] Payment address is set (where users send crypto)
- [ ] HTTPS works on all pages
- [ ] Mobile responsive design tested
- [ ] All internal links work (no 404s)

## 💳 Step 7: Payment Flow Implementation

### What needs to happen for payment:

1. **User clicks "Pay X USDC"**
2. **Wallet connects** (MetaMask/Coinbase Wallet)
3. **Switch to Base network** (if needed)
4. **Send transaction:**
   - For native ETH: Simple value transfer
   - For USDC: ERC-20 transfer to your address
5. **Wait for confirmation** (2-3 seconds on Base)
6. **Verify transaction** on your backend
7. **Generate and deliver API key**

### USDC Contract on Base:
```
Address: 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
```

### Example USDC Transfer Code:
```javascript
// USDC contract ABI (just the transfer function)
const usdcABI = [
  {
    "constant": false,
    "inputs": [
      { "name": "_to", "address": "address" },
      { "name": "_value", "uint256": "uint256" }
    ],
    "name": "transfer",
    "outputs": [{ "name": "", "type": "bool" }],
    "type": "function"
  }
];

// Send USDC
const web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
const usdcContract = new web3.eth.Contract(
  usdcABI, 
  '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913'
);

await usdcContract.methods
  .transfer(
    'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    web3.utils.toWei('29', 'mwei') // USDC has 6 decimals
  )
  .send({ from: userWalletAddress });
```

## 🔑 Step 8: API Key Generation

After payment is confirmed, you need to:

1. Generate a unique API key
2. Store it in your database with user info
3. Send it to the user via email
4. Display it in their dashboard

### Example API Key Generation:
```javascript
import crypto from 'crypto';

function generateApiKey() {
  const prefix = 'sk_live_';
  const random = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
  return prefix + random;
}

// Example: sk_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

---

## 📧 Step 9: Email Setup

Set up transactional emails for:
- Welcome email (with API key)
- Payment confirmation
- Usage alerts

**Recommended services:**
- SendGrid (12k free emails/month)
- Postmark (100 free emails/month)
- AWS SES (very cheap)

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

---

## 🧪 Step 10: Test Before Launch

### Test checklist:

1. **Wallet connection:**
   - Does MetaMask popup appear?
   - Does it switch to Base correctly?
   - Does it show connected address?

2. **Payment flow:**
   - Can you initiate a test transaction?
   - Does it show in Basescan?
   - Does API key get created?

3. **All pages:**
   - Load without errors
   - Look good on mobile
   - Links work

4. **Security:**
   - No API keys in client code
   - No private keys stored
   - HTTPS everywhere

---

## 🚦 Step 11: Go Live!

Once everything is tested:

1. Announce on social media (X/Twitter, LinkedIn)
2. Post on relevant communities:
   - r/MachineLearning
   - r/ArtificialIntelligence
   - Hacker News
   - ProductHunt
3. Email anyone who expressed interest
4. Monitor for issues closely in first 24-48 hours

---

## 📝 Customize Placeholders

Before deploying, find and replace these placeholders in the files:

**In Terms.tsx:**
- `[YOUR JURISDICTION]` → e.g., "Delaware, United States"
- `[YOUR_EMAIL]` → Your actual email
- Update copyright year if needed

**In Privacy.tsx:**
- `[YOUR COMPANY ADDRESS]` → Your business address
- Update contact emails

**In Pricing.tsx:**
- Update pricing amounts if different
- Add your actual payment contract/address

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Wallet not connecting:
- Check if MetaMask is installed
- Check if Base network is configured
- Check browser console for errors

### Styles not loading:
- Make sure CSS files are imported in TSX files
- Check file paths are correct

### Payment not working:
- Verify Base network (Chain ID: 8453)
- Check USDC contract address
- Ensure wallet has USDC balance
- Check transaction on Basescan
